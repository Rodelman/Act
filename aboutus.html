        <h2>Cebu Technological University (CTU) Bantayan,</h2><h5><p>one of the extension campuses of CTU Daanbantayan, is located in Manan-ao, Bantigue, Bantayan, Cebu. <br><p> <i>It was established in 2015 through the efforts of the late Congressman Benhur L. Salimbangon and former Municipal Mayor Ian Christopher G. Escario who entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the University President, Dr. Rosein A. Ancheta, Jr.
        
        The campus stands on a lot donated by the Maderazo family with a total land area of 17, 636. 05 square meters. Presently, the campus has twenty-one (21) classrooms, excluding the two-story building with six (6) classrooms. </i> </p>  <br> <br> <center> <img src="b.jpg" height=350> </center> <br> <br> <p><i>All in all, there are a total of seven buildings that serve as classrooms, offices, and laboratories. To cater to the needs of the students and facilitate the delivery of instruction, the campus has a computer laboratory, a Hospitality and Management Laboratory, a library, and a clinic. Through the initiatives of the Local Government Unit of Bantayan, two new additional structures were built on the campus and turned over last year- the covered court and a separate basketball court.
        
        The campus offers four undergraduate degree programs under the College of Education and the College of Technology and Engineering, to wit: Bachelor in Technology and Livelihood Education, Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management, Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</i></p></h5>
